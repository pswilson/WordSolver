# A Basic Word Solver

### Intro

This repository (will) contain various implementations of a Word Solver. The basic problem is to find all possible words you could spell from a given set of letters. Not all letters must be used in the words but the words must be 2 letters or longer. The dictionary to check against is the Scrabble tournament word list (twl06.txt.)

### Background

This project started as a basic coding exercise. Nothing really special, but an opportunity to experiment and implement something in a variety of languages.

The first implementation I did was in Java so it's what I'm putting up here first. I have a few other implementations (Python, Haskell) I'll add soon and I plan on doing the implementation in a variety of other languages as well (just for fun) (Rust, Go, C, Javascript, ...).

### Project Layout

Each language implementation is (or will be) in it's own self contained directory with a README describing anything of interest to that implementation.

### License

All code for these implementations is released under the [MIT](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) license.
